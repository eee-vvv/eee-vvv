# Hi, I'm Evie!

I am a software engineer specializing in fullstack JavaScript/TypeScript web applications, but with broader interests in Unix-like operating systems and all that comes with them, from Bash scripting and Linux system administration to learning how they work under the hood by tinkering with assembly, C, and Rust.

In 2018, after switching from computer science to linguistics to fiction writing and French, I graduated with concurrent BAs and began working in the publishing industry as a copyeditor and proofreader for clients from the MIT Press to self-publishing architects. In 2020, I found that all of the fields I studied during undergrad weren't so different after all, and that my passion for language united them. Motivated by this discovery, I began studying programming again, completed a fullstack software engineering bootcamp at [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/) and began working as a software engineer, specializing in performant, intuitive, and reliable React applications. 

In early 2022, finding myself compelled to become a more well-rounded programmer and meet others who were motivated to code by the beauty of hardware and software, I completed a batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). There, I was able to dig deeper into topics not directly related to web development and connect with one of the best, most rigorous, inclusive, and inspiring communities I have ever come across.

Now, when I am not working as a web developer, I am tinkering with an old Thinkpad running Arch, trying to wrap my head around Rust's type system, refactoring my Neovim config files in Lua, and reading fiction.
