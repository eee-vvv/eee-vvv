### I'm Evan

I'm a software engineer currently living in Providence, RI, who loves beautiful, unique UIs, well-made dev tools, and lightweight, fast, efficient code.

- Iâ€™m currently learning Rust (one chapter of "the book" at a time), having lots of fun with Next.js, and sharpening my Vim skills.
- How to reach me: https://evan.page/
- Pronouns: they/them, he/him
- Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I'm reading fiction or trying to get my hands on rare print magazines.
