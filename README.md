### I'm Evan

- Iâ€™m currently learning Rust (one chapter of "the book" at a time), having lots of fun with Next.js, and sharpening my Vim skills.
- How to reach me: https://evan.page/
- Pronouns: he/they
- Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I'm reading fiction or working my way through Earthbound for the first time :-)
