### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small, precise tools to improve my workflow.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust (one chapter of "the book" at a time) and sharpening my Vim skills
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any fullstack projects that emphasize lightweight, energy-efficient software and beautiful, intuitive UIs.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with diving deeper into the world of system programming.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how linguistics and literature help me be a better programmer.
